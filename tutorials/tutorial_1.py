Tutorial: Run Simulated Peer Reviews on a Research Manuscript

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Load a research manuscript (PDF),
2. Automatically extract and structure its content,
3. Select a target journal (to tailor reviewer expectations),
4. Generate reviewer-style feedback from multiple agents,
5. Export the results into a formatted PDF review report.

Perfect for testing, training, or preparing for real peer review.

Required Modules:
- config.py             # Contains environment flags like AUTOGEN_USE_DOCKER
- pdf_utils.py          # Extracts and structures text from PDF
- reviewers.py          # Sets up reviewer agents tailored to a journal
- review_engine.py      # Handles the review loop and response formatting
- report.py             # Outputs the final reviews as a PDF file

# Provide the path to your research paper (PDF)
